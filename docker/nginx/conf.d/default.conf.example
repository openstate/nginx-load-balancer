### HTTP SECTION

## Default response if no domain is specified.
## In case of a HTTP request on port 80 return a 404.
## In case of a HTTPS request on port 443 return the URL without HTTPS.
## This does give a warning as the domain doesn't match the cert's
## domain, but it will redirect to the correct domain if the user
## confirms the securtiy exception. This block can be uncommented once a
## certificate is available on this server (see INSTALL_HTTPS.txt).
#server {
#    listen 80;
#    return 404;
#}
#server {
#    listen 443;
#    # Specify certificate info for a domain, it doesn't matter which domain
#    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<DOMAIN>/fullchain.pem;
#    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<DOMAIN>/privkey.pem;
#    return 301 http://$host$request_uri;
#}

## Example of proxying incoming HTTP requests to a Docker container (we
## use the variable $upstream which is resolved via Docker's DNS
## 127.0.0.11 (see nginx.conf) every 30 seconds to avoid Nginx load
## balancer not starting when it can't find the Docker container):
## opencultuurdata.nl
## served by docker_c-wordpress-nginx_1
#server {
#    listen 80;
#    server_name
#        opencultuurdata.nl
#        www.opencultuurdata.nl;
#
#    location / {
#        set $upstream docker_c-wordpress-nginx_1;
#        proxy_pass http://$upstream;
#        # Preserve the host header (i.e., the domain name) otherwise
#        # WordPress MU doesn't know which site to serve
#        proxy_set_header Host $host;
#        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
#        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
#        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
#    }

## Example of a static page:
## openwob.nl
## served by static HTML
#server {
#    listen 80;
#    server_name
#        openwob.nl
#        www.openwob.nl;
#    root /usr/share/nginx/html/openwob;
#    index index.html;
#
#    # Deny acccess to any .git repo's and README's; expand this
#    # section if there are other files which should not be
#    # accessible
#    location ~ /.git/ {
#        deny all;
#    }
#    location ~ README.md {
#        deny all;
#    }
#
#    location / {
#        # First attempt to serve request as file, then
#        # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
#        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
#        # Uncomment to enable naxsi on this location
#        # include /etc/nginx/naxsi.rules
#    }
#}

## Example of a redirect:
## redirect
#server {
#    listen 80;
#    server_name
#        openzorgdata.nl
#        www.openzorgdata.nl;
#
#    location / {
#        return 301 https://openstate.eu/nl/open-zorg-data-2/;
#    }
#}


### HTTPS SECTION

## Force redirect from HTTP to HTTPS for the following domains (this section
## can be reused by unrelated domains)
#server {
#    listen 80;
#    server_name
#        accountabilityhack.nl
#        www.accountabilityhack.nl
#        hackdeoverheid.nl
#        www.hackdeoverheid.nl;
#
#    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
#}

## use the variable $upstream which is resolved via Docker's DNS
## 127.0.0.11 (see nginx.conf) every 30 seconds to avoid Nginx load
## balancer not starting when it can't find the Docker container):
